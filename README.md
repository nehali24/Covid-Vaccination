# Covid-Vaccination
Covid Vaccination data analysis. This data set deals with various fields like country, total people vaccinated, people who are fully vaccinated, daily vaccinations taking place, type of vaccines used, etc.

While cleaning data i has to drop irrelevant fields like "source name", "source website", null values. A list of unique countries from the dataset is generated and a plot is obtained with respect to "people_vaccinated".
